This is a repository containing Azure API mamangement polcies that can be used for demo purposes.

There will also be supporting REST scripts to turn on features such as EventHub logging from the proxy.  A corresponding console application includes an EventHub processor to read telemetry data going through the API Management proxy.
Eventually, PowerBI scripts will be included to visualize the requests per second.
